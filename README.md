# Insertion Sort

A simple implementation in Java of a sorting algorithm called the Insertion Sort. This program accepts an input of an array of digits **121, 4, 34, 12, 11, 2, 1** and sorts it from the lowest to highest, resulting in an array of digits **1, 2, 4, 11, 12, 34, 121**.

It's time complexity is measured as O(n^2) similar to that of Selection Sort. However it is faster than the latter when the average case is considered.
